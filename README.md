## Features
- **Vast Word Database**: The game recognizes over 12,000 four-lettered Tamil words, providing players with a wide range of options to guess and discover. With such a comprehensive word database, the gameplay experience is enriched, and players can explore various words from the Tamil language.

- **Additional Features for Tamil Language**: Unlike English, the Tamil language has a larger number of letters. To help alleviate the difficulty that arises from this wide variety of letters, some additional features have been added to the game. These features assist players in recognizing and selecting the correct letters, making the gameplay more accessible and enjoyable for Tamil-speaking players.


- **User-Friendly Interface**: The game features a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for players to navigate and interact with the game. The design focuses on providing a seamless experience, ensuring that players can fully immerse themselves in the gameplay.
